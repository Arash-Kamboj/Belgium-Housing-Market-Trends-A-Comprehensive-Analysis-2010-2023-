**Case Study: Belgium Housing Market Trends-A Comprehensive-Analysis (2010-2023)**

**Introduction**
Belgium's housing market is a dynamic landscape influenced by various economic, social, and demographic factors. To gain insights into these trends and their impacts on different municipalities across Belgium, Statbel, the Belgian statistical office, provided comprehensive datasets covering the period from 2010 to 2023. In this case study I delved into the process of analyzing and visualizing this data using a dashboard, aiming to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into Belgium's housing trends over the years.

**Objectives**

**1. Comprehensive Analysis:** Understand the overarching trends in Belgium's housing market from 2010 to 2023.

**2. Regional Comparison:** Compare housing trends across different municipalities to identify regional variations.

**3.Identify Growth Hotspots:** Identify municipalities experiencing significant growth or decline in housing metrics.

**4.Predictive Insights:** Utilize historical data to make informed predictions about future housing trends.

**Steps:**

**1. Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)**-
Download and Data Preparation:*
Obtained dataset and initiated the Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) process.

**Data Transformation:**
Utilized Power BI's Power Query Editor to extract, load, and transform the data.
Cleaned unused or erroneous rows, rectified datatype discrepancies, and ensured data accuracy and consistency.

**2. Visualizations**
Selection and Customization:
Utilized drag-and-drop functionality to create visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and tables.
Customized visuals by adjusting properties such as colors, labels, and axes.

**3. Filters and Slicers**
Interactive Data Exploration:
Implemented filters and slicers to facilitate user interaction with the data.
Included filters for parameters like year, location.

**ANALYSIS**
Let’s delve into the detailed analysis of each chart in the Belgium Housing Market Trends (2010-2023) dashboard, along with the observed trends:

**1.Median Property Valuation Over Time (by Facade Count):**
The line graph shows the median property valuation over the years, categorized by the number of facades.
**Trends:**
- Properties with 4 or more facades consistently have higher valuations compared to those with 2 or 3 facades and appartments.
- There are minor fluctuations might be due to market dynamics, economic conditions, and housing demand.
- From 2010 to 2020, the average median price was approximately 532,180 euros. However, after 2020, there was a noticeable surge, with the average median price increasing to around 571,440 euros.
  This rise could potentially be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the real estate market.

**2. Number of Houses Sold (by Facade Count):**
The bar graph displays the annual number of houses sold, differentiating between properties with 4 or more facades, those with 2 or 3 facades and appartments.
**Trends:**
- The number of sales varies each year, influenced by factors like interest rates, population growth, and housing supply.
- Properties with 4 or more facades consistently have higher sales volume whilst appartments have considerably less demand throught these years.
- 
**3.Price Ranges Across Municipalities:**
The map highlights different price ranges across Belgian municipalities.
